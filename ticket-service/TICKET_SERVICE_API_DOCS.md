## üß™ Testing the APIs

### Testing Access Control

#### **1. Project Owner Workflow**:
```bash
# Owner creates project
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer OWNER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Test Project","description":"Testing"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/api/projects

# Owner creates ticket ‚úÖ (allowed)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer OWNER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title":"Owner Ticket","priority":"HIGH","projectId":1}' \
     http://localhost:8080/api/tickets

# Owner adds member
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer OWNER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8080/api/projects/1/members/2

# Owner comments on ticket ‚úÖ (allowed)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer OWNER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content":"Owner comment"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/1/comments
```

#### **2. Project Member Workflow**:
```bash
# Member views project tickets ‚úÖ (allowed)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/project/1

# Member tries to create ticket ‚ùå (should return 403)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title":"Member Ticket","priority":"LOW","projectId":1}' \
     http://localhost:8080/api/tickets
# Expected: 403 Forbidden - Only project owners can create tickets

# Member comments on ticket ‚úÖ (allowed)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content":"Member comment"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/1/comments

# Member tries to update ticket ‚ùå (should return 403)
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"status":"IN_PROGRESS"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/1/status
# Expected: 403 Forbidden - Only project owners can update tickets
```

#### **3. Non-Member Workflow**:
```bash
# Non-member tries to view project tickets ‚ùå (should return 403)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer NON_MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/project/1
# Expected: 403 Forbidden - User is not a member of this project

# Non-member tries to comment ‚ùå (should return 403)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer NON_MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content":"Non-member comment"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/1/comments
# Expected: 403 Forbidden - Only project members can comment
```

### **Testing Recommended Endpoints**:

```bash
# Get your own projects (works for any user)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/projects/owner/YOUR_USER_ID"

# Get projects you're member of (works for any user)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/projects/member/YOUR_USER_ID"

# Try to get all projects (403 for regular users)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/projects"
# Expected: 403 Forbidden (unless you have admin privileges)
```

### **Testing Ticket Comments**:

```bash
# View comments on ticket (project members only)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/1/comments"

# Create comment (project members only)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content":"This is my comment on the ticket"}' \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/1/comments"

# Update own comment (comment author only)
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer COMMENT_AUTHOR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content":"Updated comment"}' \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/1/comments/1"

# Search comments in ticket
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/tickets/1/comments/search?keyword=security"
```
